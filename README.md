# .NET Pairing Test

Take a look over the code in this repo. When you are invited for your interview you will have a 45 minute pair programming session to complete some tasks based on this project.

### The Code

The application you will be building is an questionnaire and is written using the MVC framework. The solution uses a hardcoded/mocked repository to avoid using a real data source.

It is expected that you will produce:

- Tested maintainable code
- Clean code and OOP design
